# HolderArchiveApp

The application is part of a system that manages the processing of medical tests. In particular, it shows whether the tests are ready in this holder with test tubes. It also allows you to archive the holders when the analyses are no longer relevant.

The application interacts with the message queue RabbitMQ and with the database PostgreSQL.
